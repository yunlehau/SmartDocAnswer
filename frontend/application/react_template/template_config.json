  "description": "It is based on React framework with Tailwind CSS. The template includes the basic structure of a React project, including an index.html file and a src directory with an App.jsx file.\n Modify index.html to change web title, create new jsx files under src if needed, and rewrite src/App.jsx to meet the user's requirements. You should NOT modify src/main.jsx and src/index.css. Modify vite.config.js only if extra config is absolutely necessary.\n Style your elements with Tailwind CSS classes directly in the jsx files.",
